## Portfolio site 2023

Hi there! I'm Dalin Huang, a highly skilled and passionate full-stack developer with a specialization in Computer Science and a minor in Economics from the University of Ottawa. Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated by technology and its ability to change our lives for the better. This passion has driven me to explore various technologies and programming languages throughout my career, allowing me to work on a wide range of projects and create innovative solutions.

My Story
Growing up, I was always intrigued by how technology could transform our world. This curiosity led me to pursue a career in computer science, where I've been able to hone my skills and contribute to some truly amazing projects. With experience in front-end and back-end technologies, as well as cloud and data services, I've become well-versed in the latest industry trends and best practices.

Throughout my career, I've worked with companies such as Orium, Shopify, Combyne Ag, and Events.com, developing solutions that have made a meaningful impact on people's lives. One of my proudest achievements is co-founding HiNature Ltd, a company that focuses on eco-friendly, natural cosmetics. I developed a scanner app for WeChat that can analyze 35,000 ingredients with 95% accuracy, helping consumers make informed decisions about the products they use.

Embracing the Future with ChatGPT-4
Recently, I decided to revamp my portfolio website and wanted to try something new and exciting. That's when I discovered ChatGPT-4, a powerful AI language model from OpenAI. I was amazed by its capabilities and decided to put it to the test by having it help me create my new portfolio site.

With ChatGPT-4's assistance, I was able to design a sleek and modern site that showcases my skills, experiences, and accomplishments. The AI model not only provided me with the HTML and CSS code but also assisted in crafting an engaging introduction for my GitHub readme. This experience has left me in awe of the potential for AI in the world of web development and beyond.

As technology continues to evolve, I'm more excited than ever about the future and the possibilities it holds. I can't wait to see how AI will transform the way we live, work, and create. And as a passionate developer, I'm eager to continue exploring and innovating in this rapidly changing field.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of the projects I've worked on and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or have any questions!
